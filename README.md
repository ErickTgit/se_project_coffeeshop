# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to add a few more animations to really make the page feel alive, while not having too many as to seem unprofessional. I like websited I visit to feel interactive and alive, so that something I try to implement into my work unless otherwise stated.

_UPDATE_ i was able to finally remove the <span> tag that I used to style the checkbox, with some help from the TripleTen code reviewers! Big thanks!
